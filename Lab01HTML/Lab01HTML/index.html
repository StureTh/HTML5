           <h3>Story Time</h3> 
            <p>
                Since i was a little kid i always loved <mark>computers</mark> and gaming in general. When i was five years on Christmas eve i gott my first gaming console a Super Nintendo 8 Bits.
                Later about one year or so my dad came home with the first home <mark>computer</mark> to our family.  It always helped me relax and be creative in my tought processes,
                Like how do fix this problem or solve certain puzzle. <em>There is nothing more satisfying than to solve a problem you been sitting with for hours sometimes even days before it clicks.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasnt untill about six months ago i discoverd the world och programming and software development. I started to read more about it and tought, this maybe is the stuff i can enjoy and work with for years to come.
                I found the School "EC-Utbildning" and they offered a Web developer program that i started this spring. Even though im still very new on this topic I really enjoy it and having a blast learning more and more everyday.
                Sometimes it feels like all the years of reading about computers in general and all the puzzles solved help me learn even quicker.

            <h3>Music and Creativity goes and in hand</h3>
            <p>
                Music has always been a big part of my life. <strong>There is nothing else ive found that help me concentrate and be creative at the same time.</strong> You can swap music styles depening on mood
                and there is always a playlist or track for a certain situation. I would like to learn to play the piano but time will tell when its time for that project.
